min from the city of Mantua, on the lbth day of October, in the year of
Reme 684, and '10 years before the Christian era. Pompey the Grest and

'l'he first seven years of his life were passed under his patemal roos: alter
which he was removed to Cremona, a town situated upon the bsnks of the Po,
aad not far from Mantus. While here, he distinguished himself in those studies
united to his age, and gave presago ef his future eminence. ln this pleasant
retreat he passed ten years, till he assumed the Toga virilis, which, among the
Romans, was at the age of l'l. At an early period he shewed himself ιο boa
