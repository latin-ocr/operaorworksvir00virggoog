blame upon Augustus, and murmured against his administration. To remedy
tho exietiug evils, aud to arert haavier calamites, it becam necenaty to revive
rgriculture; which tor many years had been almost wholly neglected, the peo
ploheing taken from their lands to supply the arrnies. lt occurred to Maecenas
that a treadse upon that subject would he highly usetul to the inhabitants ol'
luly3 he therefore engaged virgil, who had just liniahed his Eclogues, to
mdertake the work. It had the desired effect. For, aller the publication oi

psovple found themselves in plenty, and in the enjoyment ol' peace and content

h'v rhrsto style, end above all, his extensive knowledge, duly qurlified hira sor

'lhe word Georgica is from the Greek. Its original word properly signilies
the cultivation or tillage os the earth. In the Georgics‚ Virgil imitated Hesiod‚
rho wrote a nahae upon this subject, entitled‚ Opera et Dies, buthe sarea-
ocllad him in every respect. He began this port os his works in the year ol
Rome ⁷1⁷, heing then about thirty-two years os· nge, end dedicated it to illm·
mae his fiiend and patron, at whose request he wrote it.

'l'he Georgica are divided into l'our books. The first treatsof the various
todo, and the proper method olmanaging each. The second treats osthe various
ruys ot‘ propagating t‘ruit noes, and particularly the vine. The third treats oi
tlte several kinds os grass, and the proper method ol' raising horses, cattle,
sheep, and goats. The fourth treats os the proper management os bees.

With the main subject, the poet hath interwoven several very interesting sablea
tud episodes, which contributo to our pleaaure, and relieve the mind under the
