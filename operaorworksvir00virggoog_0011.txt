“ So laras 1 bava had opportunity ιο examine ιιο manuscriptos the Rev. J.
G. Coeper fora new edition os tha Works oi virgil, Ι highly approre οι tha
plan, and think it well calculated to facilitate the study os the poet. lt appears
to be a leading object with Mr. (leopanto lighten the burden os theptudent,
by elucidating the difficolt passages ol the author, and by leading the youthsul
mind into a relish of his beautms and excellencies.

Tha substitution osan Ordo os the most intricate passages in the room os a
general interpretation οΙ the text, Ι considera material advantage. While it
removes the difficulties in the collocatiou os the words, it leads the student rnore
direotly to tha text, and tenda to fix his attention more closely upon the language
ot* tha poet. On the whole, Iconsider the tvork deserving ol public patronage:
and 1 wish him every encouragement inhia endeavours to promote the interestis
