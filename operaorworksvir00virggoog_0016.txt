Soon alieri commenced the instruction ol youth, I became sensrhle οἰ the
impropriety ol the use ol the editions ol Virgil, then in our schools. Those ot
Ruaus and Davidson were generally, il' not exclusively, read, both equally
objectionable, the former by adording too little aid ιο the student in the illus
