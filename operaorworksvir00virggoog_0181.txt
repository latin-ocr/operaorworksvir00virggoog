saue distance from the city, bearing his aged father upon his shouldenr, trud
leading his little son by the hand. He was followedby great numbers ofhis
countryrnen, who had escaped the flames and the sword Ar Antandrum
arnall town in the heighborhood of Troy he built him a fleat of twenty ships,

and having fumished hImself wrth all things necessary for his errterprise, set sail
ιιι search of a new settlement. He visited Thrace. Here he founded a city
which he called AEaos. He abandoned his undertaking at the direction ottho
ghost of his friend. Thence hesailed tectore, tha land of Teucer, ona of tha
founders of the Trajan raca. Here he attempted a settlement, but through tha
unhcalthiness os the climate, was compelled to relinquish it, aller losinga great
number of his companions. ln the midst of his distress, he is informedin a
vision, thot Italy, the birth ploce of Dardanus, was the land destined to him by
the gdds. Upon this information he loll Creto; and, aficr various fortunas by
sea and land, he arrived ιιι ltaly' ur about seven years aller his departure from

' hisnativo land He was kmdly recerved by Latinus, krng of Latiam, who pro·

to bestow upon him his daughter Lacinia, the heiress of his kingdom.
mus, king of the Rutuli, a brave and valiant prince, had long sought har ur
marriage. He opposed hor connexion with AErroas. This occasioned a bloody
war, in which most of the Italion princes were engaged, on one side or tho
other. lt ended in the death of Turnus, which closes the AEneid.
AEneos afterwards married Lavinia, and succeeded Latinus in his kingdom.
He builtocity, which he called Lacinium, inhonor of his wife. This he mado
the seat of his government He was succeeded by Ascanius, or liilus, who
reigned thirty years, when he built Atta longo, to which he removed with his
court. llere the govemmerrt was administered by a line of Trojan princes for
three hundred years, till Romulus arose, who founded the city of Rome. Atrei
Romulus, the royal lina was broken, aird tbe government transferred to Numa

Pom pilius, a Sabine.
Tha three frrst books are not arranged ιιι the order of time. 'The second

hook, which relatos the downfall of Troy, andis the basis of tho poem, is tbo
frrst ιιι time. Γ he third, which relates the voyage os AEneas, till atter· his
departure from Sicily for Italy, follows. The frrst, which relates the disper·
sion of his fleet, and his arrival in Africa, with his kind receptior hy Dido,
succeeds the third. The restare all in the order of time. But this change,
so far from being a defect in the poem, is an advantage, and shows the⁴
judgment of tlre poet. He was enabled thereby to make his hero relato the
downfall of his country, and the various fortunas os his long and eventful
voyage.

The poet hath contrivcd to introduce rnto his poem the outlines of the Ro·
man history, and a number of interesting episodes, which add to the whole
beauty and entertainment. · ·
