'ln AEneid ia a heroic, or opio poem. lt tales its name from AEneas, the

r tta of Anchises and Venus. By his fadaer, he was allied to the royal family ol'

Troy. He was also the souin-law of Priam; whose daughter, Creusa, he had

netad. AEneas is the hero of the poem. lte subjectis his removal into
ltaly nith a colony of Trojano, and their settlement in that country.

llirgil uas forty years of age when he commeneed the AEnevd. He had just
hahart the Georgica: and Augustus, now thirty-three years old, had undis-
turbed possemion os the Roman empire. And nothing appeared to interrupt
tle miserat reposo, eo desirable aller the long civil ware that had desolated
thehiveet portione of it. lt was at this moment, when the mmds of the Roman
pepla vvere turned from the desolating soenes of war to the mildor arts of
μου, that the poet conceived the plan of writing tlre AEneid, a poem second
only to the Iliad, for tbe entertainment and instruction of his countrymen.

· lbere are some, who think the principal object of the poet tvae to datter the
pride and vanity of the Roman people, and especially Augtrstue. who was now
atat to the highest temporal power.

lhis part of his vvorlvs is by far the noblest, though not the most perfect and
fisslthetl lt was his intention te have revised it before he published it te the
vorld3 but he died leaving it incompleta, as appears by several imperfect lines
found in different parts of it. He bequeethed the whole to Augustus, vvho put

l lle manuscript into the hands of Tucca and Varus for publication, nith an
lpjunetion not to alter, in any way, the manuscript, nor to fill up the imperfect
t [tes.

ln the first six books, Virgll imitates the Odyssey of Homer3 in the last six,
lefollons the lliad; and it is probable that we should not have had the AEneid,
¹s we had not, at the same time, the Odyssey and the lliad also. llomer may

- {clnovledged that the Roman excelled the Grecian in many instances, par·
ltcularly in propriety and judgment.

Paris, the son os Priam, nn accomplished prince, visited the court of Mene·
laus. by n'lrom he vvas received with the greatest cordiality. llere he became
ettnptured with the beautiful Helen, the wife of his host, and conceived the
hese purpose of taking her with him to Troy. Taking advantage of the absence
ef her husband, he put his plan into execution. This atrocious deod excited
egeneral indignation through the states of Greeee3 and, aller sending an
enbassy to Τ roy upon the subject, to no purpose, it was determined, as the
hrt reson, to declaro vvar against Priam, and with the united soreos ef the
Grecian princes, to avenge the perfidious act.

Altera siege of ten years, the city was taken by stratagern, and rased to the
