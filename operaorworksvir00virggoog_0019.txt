Pollio, who entertained a sincere friendship for Virgil, 888 was well qualibed
to form a correct estimate of his talents and acquirentem, becoming acquaint-
ed with his case, recommended him to Maecenas, who was then at Rome, and
held the highest place of honor 888 confidence with his prince. The friend of
Pollio found also afriend in Maecenas. He laid his case before Augustus, and
by his influence with his prince, obtained the restoration of his estate. Virgil,
81 this time, probably was about 29 years of age. lle immediately returned
with the edictos the emperor for the restoration of his farm, which had sallon
into the hands of one Areus, a centurion ; but he was resisted 888 ill-treated hy
the new possessor, 888 forced to swim over the Mincius to cavebis life. 'l'his
cruel treatment is the subject of the mnth Eclogue.

He went a second time to Rome upon the subject. But it is probable he

88 mede the seat of the empire the place of his residence. Here his acquaint-
ance and friendship were eought by the most distinguished men 3 and the favorite

With 8 view to compliment his prince, and to express the happy state of the

Virgil's modesty and diffidcnce prevented him from making an avowal. At

poet, who lime the same lines upon the gato of fhe palace, with the following
one under em:

together with the beginning of another line in these words,

Sic 888 noa vobis,

way of doing it, demanded that the lines should be finished. Several attempta
were made without effect. Bathyllus was not able to doit3 which led to 8
suspicion of his impostore. At last Virgil finished tlrem, and thus avowed him-

, 8811188 author ofthe previous distich. The lines are as follow:
